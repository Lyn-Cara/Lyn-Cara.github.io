                Tobi Sunmola
            </h2>
            <p>
                Born in Lagos Nigeria, the young rapper discovered his fascination and inspiration for making music when
                he
                was
                13 years
                old. Beginning his musical journey in Nigeria, he migrated to the UK at the age of 17 where he found a
                youth
                club that
                allowed him to create music for free and release music as a solo artiste under the alias ''Stripez''.
                His
                music
                evolved
                into melodies, production and songwriting.
